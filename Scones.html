    <img src="IMG_0694.jpg" width="460" height="350">

    <H2>INGREDIENTS</H2>

    <LI>3 cups (381 grams) all-purpose flour</LI>
    <LI>1/3 cup (66 grams) granulated sugar</LI>
    <LI>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</LI>
    <LI>1 tablespoon baking powder</LI>
    <LI>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</LI>
    <LI>1 1/2 sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter, cold and cubed</LI>
    <LI>1 cup (237 grams) buttermilk</LI>
    <LI>2 large eggs, divided</LI>
    <LI>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</LI>
    <LI>Coarse sugar</LI>

    <H2>INSTRUCTIONS</H2>
    <H4>STEP 1</H4>
    <LI>Adjust the oven rack to the center position and preheat to 400Â°F. Line two baking pans with parchment paper.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 2</H4>
    <LI>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda.></LI>
    <H4>STEP 3</H4>
    <LI>Add the butter and cut with a pastry cutter or a fork until the butter is the size of large peas.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 4</H4>
    <LI>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, 1 egg, and vanilla extract.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 5</H4>
    <LI>Make a well in the middle and add the liquid mixture. Mix until just combined. Don't over mix. If adding in dried fruit, nuts, chocolate, or other flavorings, do so now.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 6</H4>
    <LI>Transfer the dough to a floured surface. *Optional Step: See Recipe Notes for lamination instructions.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 7</H4>
    <LI>Divide into 2 equal parts. Lightly knead each into 3/4-inch thick, 6-inch diameter rounds. Cut each round into 8 wedges and place on your prepared baking pans. Space them out about 2 inches apart.</LI>
   <h3>MAKE AHEAD</h3>
    <H4>STEP 8</H4>
    <LI>At this point the unbaked scones can be refrigerated overnight, or sealed and frozen for up to 1 month. If baking from frozen, add about 2 minutes to the baking time.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 9</H4>
    <LI>In a small bowl, combine the remaining egg with 1 teaspoon water. Brush over the scones. Sprinkle with the coarse sugar.</LI>
    <H4>STEP 10</H4>
    <LI>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. The scones are best served warm, or within a few hours of baking.</LI>
